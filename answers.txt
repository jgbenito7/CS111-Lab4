# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We used the fork() system call to have processes run in parallel. We placed this call inside of the 
for loop in the download and upload part of the main function so that there would be one one child 
process per instance of downloading or uploading.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

The use of strcpy has the potential to be unsafe due to the possibility of a buffer overrun. We changed this to 
strncpy and set FILENAMESIZ to be the max amount of bytes able to be copied over. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We fixed the possibility of peers serving files outside of the current directory. We did this by looking for 
a '/' in the filename. 

We increased the size of the task buffer to add support for larger tasks.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
